            <h2>Hey cee,</h2>
            <p>
              This website is a passion project dedicated entirely to you. Unconventional, but probably
              the most stereotypical thing that I could do as a CS Major. The culmination of my dedication
              to you and my compromise as a broke ass individual. Nothing else drove me to make a project
              as much as showing how much you meant to me did. I love you, and I hope I can show it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for sticking with me thus far. I know it's been quite the long ride but i am
                so so grateful that I've had such a supportive woman in my life. You have taught me
                how to love myself, and how to love you as best i can. 
            </p>

                12 months is a long time to think about. In a year, people can accomplish so many things.
                Some go from broke to rich, some make a name for themselves, some find their place in the world.
                Me? I found you. In my eyes, that makes me feel like I've accomplished everything in the universe,
                for you are my everything. I want to continue loving you for as long as the sun still shines,
                and my heart still beats; For my heart beats to nothing if not the tune of your song.
            </p>
            <p>
              And what a beautiful song I have experienced over the course of 365 days. I've felt so many
              emotions, so many ups and downs it would make the biggest roller coaster seem like child's play.
              And yet, I still want more. I wish for this song to go on and on, to never hear what the end sounds like,
              for this has been the ride of a lifetime; I wish to know no other.
            </p>
            <p>
              So thank you, Christina. For being by my side even when I push you away, loving me when I am
              unlovable, and being there when I need you. I truly am blessed to have a love such as yours, and
              want to build up our relationship to be the strongest it can be. Thank you for being you.
